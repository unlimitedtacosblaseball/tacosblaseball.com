## LA Unlimited Tacos Land Acknowledgement

The LA Unlimited Tacos acknowledges that the land the team exists in today is the home of the Tongva, Gabrielino-Tongva, or Kizh peoples. Los Angeles was colonized originally by Spain and then Mexico, before being annexed by the United States in the mid-1800s. Via government policies of Manifest Destiny and its explicit genocidal nature, the Kizh and Tongva communities were erased from the consciousness of many throughout the US. Therefore, as people dealing with the unceded land of those communities, we must acknowledge and remember this violent history which we build upon.

As a community we acknowledge that there is much to be done for the rights and welfare of the Kizh, Tongva and many other Indigenous peoples throughout the United States and Canada and we commit ourselves to be actively working to be anti-racist, anti-colonialist, and anti-imperialist, be that by educating ourselves and each other about Native issues, organizing events or spaces to actively support the First Nations in the Los Angeles region and beyond, or through any other ways people can.

Here are some resources for more information on Indigenous and First Nations both for the Los Angeles area and the World:
- The official website of the Kizh Nation is [gabrielenoindians.org/](https://gabrielenoindians.org).
- The official website of the Tongva Nation is [gabrielino-tongva.com/](http://gabrielino-tongva.com/).

There are many books about Native people's history in the US, a great one to start with is *[An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States](https://bookshop.org/books/an-indigenous-peoples-history-of-the-united-states/9780807057834)* by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz.

This is all a constant work in progress, and as such if there are any mistakes, criticisms, or additional resources you have, or would like to add, please contact one of the Captains, or Theremin at @thethereminguy#3538 to have us improve this document.
