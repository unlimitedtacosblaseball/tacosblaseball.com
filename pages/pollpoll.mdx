We'll leave this open until 7PM Eastern / 4PM Pacific tomorrow . At that time, there will be another ping (sorry!) and we will organize votes for liftoff (if we're not there already by that time). Feel free to use <Channel>navigation-panic-how-do-i-steer-this-thing</Channel> (the link to the discord is in <Yellow>[team resources](/resources)</Yellow>) to bring up ideas that haven't been mentioned yet!
