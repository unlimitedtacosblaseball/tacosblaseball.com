### Tacos Lore
<Subheader>Well... a starter guide</Subheader>

There are some of the most popular interpretations of our characters, but by no means the only ones. If you have your own interpretation, feel free to stop by the Taco Stand and share it with us, because we'd love to hear it!

#### What is in this

- **Active Tacos:** Playing for the team now
- **Shadow Tacos:** Part of the team, but not playing blaseball
- **Active Alumni:** Playing for other teams, but still <3
- **Inactive Alumni:** Some in the shadows. Some taken from us tragically

#### A Note About Names

As you've probably noticed, the Tacos have *several* players named Wyatt as alumni. This means that referring to players as "Wyatt" gets confusing fast. For the sake of simplicity, we usually refer to Wyatt-named players by their **surnames** (e.g. Dovenpart, Pothos, etc.).

(We also have severalplayers with the surname Mason for the same reason. These ones you can use their first names for.)

*Wyatt Mason IV is known as Ivy!*

The two Basilios and two Rats are just coincidence, though. It's easiest to use surnames for Fig and Batson, and assume if you see their first names it's referring to the other one.
