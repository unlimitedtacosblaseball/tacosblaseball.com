### What is the Taco Stand?

**The Unlimited Taco Stand**—often called "the Stand" or the "sidecord"—is a Discord server dedicated to the Tacos fanbase. Most people here come from "maincord", the official Blaseball Discord server.

If you are not a Taco that migrated from maincord, then all you need to know is that the stand is an extended arm of our maincord presence. Many of us, including the moderators, admins, and general leadership, will use the maincord server as an example for conduct in this server.

The Stand was made because Tacos are Big. And Loud. And Do-All-the-Stuff! We needed room to stretch, as we are constantly expanding and, yes, doing *stuff*.

The stand is a great place to experience a Blaseball that fits your needs! But if it's not your jam, that's okay too! Enjoy Blaseball at whatever level you feel is best.

### Colors! Roles! Emojis!

<Subheader>

We have *lots* of colors! And Roles! And emojis!

</Subheader>

At this point you have, hopefully, received your first role: you are a Taco. Next, you can select pronoun roles so we know how to address you. Hopefully you have also given yourself a few \*ping\* roles. If you haven't, check out <Channel>the-menu</Channel> and... get yourselfs some pingable roles!

Each pingable role has its own shade of <span style={{ color: '#745dea' }}>**purple**</span>!

%% TODO: Add image of roles.

Here are some other colors you will see around the stand:

<div className="roles-list">

<ul>
    <li style={{ color: '#26d4a8' }}><strong>Moderator Mint</strong></li>
    <li style={{ color: '#fdac31' }}><strong>Representative Gold</strong></li>
    <li style={{ color: '#438f64' }}><strong>Helper Green</strong></li>
    <li style={{ color: '#745dea' }}><strong>Taco Purple</strong></li>
    <li style={{ color: '#f52f53' }}><strong>Visitor Salsa Red</strong></li>
  </ul>

</div>

%% TODO: Add image of all the emojis.

### Info Channels

<Subheader>V information. V important.</Subheader>

As you make your way around the Stand, a good place to keep going back to are the info channels. Each channel has a purpose, such as keeping you updated on maincord, or Taco Stand announcements, occasionally introducing new people, or holding discussions for requested changes to the server (which you can also do!).

<DiscordList title="📚 Info" contents={["rules", "the-menu", "resources", "announcements", "tacos-announcements", "introductions", "server-suggestions", "server-help", "bot-commands"]}/>

%% TODO: Connect graphic with asides

<aside className="red-aside">

Even if you're not interested in server discussions or introductions, we recommend you keep <Channel>announcements</Channel> unmuted, so you don't miss any important news.

</aside>

<aside className="green-aside">

If you get stuck or have something funky going on with your roles, please tell us here.

</aside>

### Hangout

<Subheader>For everything not-blaseball. Mostly.</Subheader>

It's a Blaseball server an Blaseball is going to happen *everywhere*, but if you want to talk about something completely different, this is the place it happens!

<DiscordList title="🎡 Hangout" contents={["general-channel", "games-and-hobbies", "klaut-containment-zone", "post-yer-pets", "taco-bout-food", "natureposting", "good-stuff"]}/>

<aside>

#### Some things you'll notice:

1. The <Channel>general-channel</Channel> name changes a lot, mostly during siesta.
2. Enjoy the playlist!
3. <Channel>taco-bout-food</Channel> is cursed.
4. <Channel>natureposting</Channel> and <Channel>post-yer-pets</Channel> are *not* cursed.
5. The starboard (aka the <Channel>good-stuff</Channel>) is best read with no context.

</aside>

### Al Pastor Memorial Park

<Subheader>Hope you like Blaseball.</Subheader>

This is where the Blaseball happens! Blaseball talking, Blaseball watching, Blaseball money making, Blaseball shenanigans, and Blaseball news. It's *all* Blaseball, *all* the time blabeyyy!

<DiscordList title="⚾️ Al Pastor Memorial Park" contents={["newsroom", "blaseball-general", "watch-tacos", "blaseball-questions", "shenanigans-planigans", "coins-bets-concessions"]}/>

<aside className="red-aside">

  Highlights (lowlights?) and on-topic convos go here, just like in maincord.
  
</aside>

<aside className="yellow-aside">

A watch channel! It's pretty similar to maincord or a Twitch party. During the season, it goes brrr.

</aside>

<aside className="green-aside">Go here for current Blaseball shenanigans and coin-making tips'n'tricks. Any and all Blaseball questions are welcome, too!</aside>

This is also the place to find information about Blaseball. If you've been gone for a few days (or even a few hours!) and want an update, check the <Channel>newsroom</Channel>! If you need some questions answered, check <Channel>blaseball-questions</Channel>. If you want to know about the latest team or league-wide shenanigans, check the <Channel>shenanigans-planigans</Channel> room.

%% TODO: Add an image of the newsroom channel revealing into the contents of the newsroom channel.

<aside><span className="yellow" style={{ textTransform: 'uppercase' }}><strong>Don't forget:</strong></span> Check the pins of every channel you're cruising. Get yourself comfortable with pinging helpers and mods, if needed, and don't be afraid to ask questions!</aside>

%% TODO: Add some little graphics of pinging the mods

### Strategy (Burrito)

<Subheader>Quite like Dr. Frankenstein's creation...</Subheader>

Our Strategy Burrito! What a **beautiful** creature. **Just look at these channels**.
 
<DiscordList title="🌯 Strategy" contents={["strats-announcements", "voting-batting", "fk-and-stats", "stadium-committee", "gift-shop-discussion", "strat-balks"]}/>

<aside className="red-aside">

The simplest level is only paying attention to announcements as well as internal polls. Perfect for those who want their strat as a grab-and-go meal.

</aside>

<aside className="yellow-aside">

Next level down, are the actual discussion and pitching process.

<p><Channel>voting-discussion</Channel> is where you talk out ideas, treat every idea as a good faith idea.</p>

<p><Channel>voting-pitches</Channel> is where fleshed out ideas go. Pitches which meet a weekly threshold go on our ballot.</p>

</aside>

<aside className="green-aside">

This is where detailed information can be found. Discussion as to "what we should do" does not go here. Instead, expect qusetions like "what is Bob LastName's strength?"
  
</aside>

<aside>

"FK" stands for [Forbidden Knowledge](https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Help:Forbidden_Knowledge). This is extra information about the game which is usually "opt in".

<Yellow>**Story spoilers are not allowed here!**</Yellow>

</aside>

<aside className="red-aside">

The next layer of the burrito are the specialised channels.

Stadium talk goes in <Channel>stadium-committee</Channel>.

Gift shop talk goes in <Channel>gift-shop-discussion</Channel>.

Simple as that.

</aside>

<aside>

**Balk** = Illegal motion made by a pitcher made to deceive a base runner or batter AKA a fake pitch.

</aside>

<aside className="blue-aside">

Got a goofy idea? Joke pitches go here. <span style={{ textTransform: 'uppercase' }}>Have fun!</span>

</aside>

### Lore Engine

<Subheader>Have you heard of Wyatt Mason?</Subheader>

This is a lot of where the wiki stuff happens, but it's not only wiki work! If you have head canons, ideas to generate about our players, or want to come up with something entirely new about the infinite Los Angeli, this is your place!

%% TODO: add lore engine discord channel graphic

<DiscordList title="🚂 Lore Engine" contents={["lore-general", "lore-general-2", "lore-preserves", "lore-jam-boree", "library-fk-speculation", "wiki-workshop", "lore-updates", "player-interviews", "nan-starboard", "peanut-bong-starboard", "trade-starboard", "wyatt-mason-iv-starboard"]}/>

<aside className="yellow-aside">

We <span style={{ textTransform: 'uppercase' }}>highly</span> encourage Tacos to take initiative in this area! The wiki is for everyone, not just reps or wiki historians. If you want to add a few things to the wiki, please check out the next few slides, which will show you how to put up your ideas

</aside>

<aside className="green-aside">

These are the general lore channels, there are two because one wasn't enough, talk in either or both, go wild!

</aside>

<aside className="yellow-aside">

A lore starboard is much like the general starboard, in which messages that receive enough reacts from emojis that are connected to a starboard will end up there. It's a nice way to collect ideas people like for a player.

</aside>

The same rules apply to Wiki additions as apply to the entire server. Please read [the mandatory wiki rules](https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Help:Style_Guide) before making any changes.

%% TODO: add the step by step guidelines in the google slides.

<aside>

If you need help with the wiki, feel free to **ping** a **Mod** or a **Lore Librarian**.

</aside>

### Fanworks

<Subheader>Make stuff. Show off!</Subheader>

These channels are specifically to show off, talk about, and promote your blaseball-related fanworks. If you are from maincord, then you are familiar with what goes here, except now there are additional channels to allow for different mediums to shine. Each channel has a description, so please read them.

%% TODO: Add a graphic of the fanworks section of the taco stand discord

<DiscordList title="🎨 Fanworks" contents={["visual-art", "non-visual-art", "gallery", "tacoganda", "birbs-taco-dating-sim"]}/>

<aside className="red-aside">

This is the place for visual art. Sketches, graphics, any sort of work created in a visual medium can go here. You can also chat about the works.

</aside>

<aside className="blue-aside">

This is the place for non-visual art. This includes songs, podcasting, or written works of all sorts.

</aside>

### Gallery & Tacoganda

<Subheader>Look with your eyes</Subheader>

<DiscordList title="🎨 Fanworks" contents={["visual-art", "non-visual-art", "gallery", "tacoganda", "birbs-taco-dating-sim"]}/>

<aside className="green-aside">

Any work can go into the <Channel>gallery</Channel>! Completed or not, this is the storage vault for any creatod work, so it doesn't get lost in the chatter of normal fanwork channels! Please don't post anything here that isn't a fanwork! Comments and conversation can go in the other channels.

</aside>

<aside className="yellow-aside">

Tacoganda is what Tacos call "propaganda made or distributed by Tacos fans". This channel houses graphics communicating our plans so we can share with maincord. It works hand-in-hand with the <Channel>shenanigans-planigans</Channel> channel. Everything here is shareable, without credit. All graphics should have an image description. Please be aware of this before you post.

</aside>


### Project Channels

<Subheader>
  
Did we mention that Tacos do *stuff*?
  
</Subheader>

Project channels can be requested in <Channel>server-suggestions</Channel>. A template is included in the pins, which also has guidelines for what a project might entail. The project must be approved before the channel is made.

%% TODO: add other graphics of projects

<p><Yellow>For example:</Yellow></p>

<DiscordList contents={["klaut-containment-zone"]}/>

<DiscordList contents={["away-games-collab-zone"]}/>

<aside>

<Yellow><strong>PSA:</strong></Yellow> If you are starting a project channel, you must take responsibility for it! You'll be granted special channel privileges for the duration of the channel's existence. Use them responsibly.

</aside>

### Contact Leadership

<Subheader>Occasionally called "Tacos Supreme" by, like one person.</Subheader>

The Taco Stand consists of three layers:

<p><span style={{ color: '#438f64' }}><strong>Helpers:</strong></span> Helpers are here to help! Need something pinned? Ping a helper! Need a question answered? Ping a helper! Can't get ahold of a rep or mod? Ping a helper! There's a theme here.</p>

<p><span style={{ color: '#fdac31' }}><strong>Representatives:</strong></span> Representatives represent the team. They communicate with keepers on behalf of the team, (though you can also reach out to the keepers at any time with a modmail or a ping!) and have pin and manage messages permissions in the taco maincord channels. In the Taco Stand, their powers are much the same. They are not in charge of moderating the Stand, or making decisions for the server. If you want to get in touch with another team through leadership, representatives are the ones to talk to!</p>

<p><span style={{ color: '#26d4a8' }}><strong>Moderators:</strong></span> The majority of moderators are also <span style={{ color: '#fdac31' }}><strong>Representatives</strong></span> however they have a few extra responsibilities and powers in the Taco Stand for community management. Moderators who are also not Reps do not have maincord responsibilities. Moderators make changes to the server, enforce server rules, and answer modmails. Please use modmail to reach the moderators! You can also ping us at any time.</p>

### Who & How to Contact

<Subheader>Reach out to us. It's why we're here.</Subheader>

If you don't want to ping these roles, you can also reach out directly to <span style={{ color: '#26d4a8' }}><strong>Moderators</strong></span> via DM, or, preferably, ModMail. **ModMail** is a discord bot that you DM. This opens a conversation between you and the mods and reps of the taco stand, so you may speak with them privately.

<aside>

<span className="yellow"><strong>Please use ModMail!</strong></span> It's there for everyone! Even if it's something small and dumb, or nice and positive, we will see it and respond!

</aside>

### The End.

<Subheader><span style={{ textTransform: 'uppercase' }}>Yay</span>! You made it!</Subheader>

You are now officially a Taco and we love you already. No hazing required!

Remember to refer to the info channels for links and updates. Ask your questions freely in our chat, we are nice and will answer. And don't forget about ModMail! Promise we don't bite.

Enjoy your stay in the infinite Los Angeli!
