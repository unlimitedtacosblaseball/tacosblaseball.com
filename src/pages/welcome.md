### What is the Taco Stand?

**The Unlimited Taco Stand**—often called "the Stand" or the "sidecord"—is a Discord server dedicated to the Tacos fanbase. Most people here come from "maincord", the official Blaseball Discord server.

If you are not a Taco that migrated from maincord, then all you need to know is that the stand is an extended arm of our maincord presence. Many of us, including the moderators, admins, and general leadership, will use the maincord server as an example for conduct in this server.

The Stand was made because Tacos are Big. And Loud. And Do-All-the-Stuff! We needed room to stretch, as we are constantly expanding and, yes, doing *stuff*.

The stand is a great place to experience a Blaseball that fits your needs! But if it's not your jam, that's okay too! Enjoy Blaseball at whatever level you feel is best.

### Colors! Roles! Emojis!

At this point you have, hopefully, received your first role: you are a Taco. Next, you can select pronoun roles so we know how to address you. Hopefully you have also given yourself a few \*ping\* roles. If you haven't, check out <span class="channel">#the-menu</span> and... get yourselfs some pingable roles!

Each pingable role has its own shade of <span style="color:#745dea;"><strong>purple</strong></span>!

%% TODO: Add image of roles.

Here are some other colors you will see around the stand:

<div class="roles-list">
  <ul>
    <li style="color:#26d4a8;"><strong>Moderator Mint</strong></li>
    <li style="color:#fdac31;"><strong>Representative Gold</strong></li>
    <li style="color:#438f64;"><strong>Helper Green</strong></li>
    <li style="color:#745dea;"><strong>Taco Purple</strong></li>
    <li style="color:#f52f53;"><strong>Visitor Salsa Red</strong></li>
  </ul>
</div>

%% TODO: Add image of all the emojis.

### Info Channels

As you make your way around the Stand, a good place to keep going back to are the info channels. Each channel has a purpose, such as keeping you updated on maincord, or Taco Stand announcements, occasionally introducing new people, or holding discussions for requested changes to the server (which you can also do!).

%% TODO: Add graphic of the info section of the discord

%% TODO: Connect graphic with asides

<aside class="red-aside">Even if you're not interested in server discussions or introductions, we recommend you keep <span class="channel">#announcements</span> unmuted, so you don't miss any important news.</aside>

<aside class="green-aside">If you get stuck or have something funky going on with your roles, please tell us here.</aside>

### Hangout

It's a Blaseball server an Blaseball is going to happen *everywhere*, but if you want to talk about something completely different, this is the place it happens!

%% TODO: Add graphic of the hangout section of the discord server

<aside>
<h4> Some things you'll notice:</h4>
<ol>
<li>1. The <span class="channel">#general-channel</span> name changes a lot, mostly during siesta.</li>
<li>2. Enjoy the playlist!</li>
<li>3. <span class="channel">#taco-bout-food</span> is cursed.</li>
<li>4. <span class="channel">#natureposting</span> and <span class="channel">#post-yer-pets</span> are *not* cursed.</li>
<li>5. The starboard (aka the <span class="channel">#good-stuff</span>) is best read with no context.</li>

%% TODO: Add graphic of the Al Pastor Memorial Park channel section

<aside class="red-aside">Highlights (lowlights?) and on-topic convos go here, just like in maincord.</aside>

<aside class="yellow-aside">A watch channel! It's pretty similar to maincord or a Twitch party. During the season, it goes brrr.</aside>

<aside class="green-aside">Go here for current Blaseball shenanigans and coin-making tips'n'tricks. Any and all Blaseball questions are welcome, too!</aside>

This is also the place to find information about Blaseball. If you've been gone for a few days (or even a few hours!) and want an update, check the <span class="channel">#newsroom</span>! If you need some questions answered, check <span class="channel">#blaseball-questions</span>. If you want to know about the latest team or league-wide shenanigans, check the <span class="channel">#shenanigans-planigans</span> room.

%% TODO: Add an image of the newsroom channel revealing into the contents of the newsroom channel.

<aside><span class="yellow" style="text-transform:uppercase;"><strong>Don't forget:</strong></span> Check the pins of every channel you're cruising. Get yourself comfortable with pinging helpers and mods, if needed, and don't be afraid to ask questions!</aside>

### Strategy (Burrito)

Our Strategy Burrito! What a **beautiful** creature. **Just look at these channels**.

%% TODO: Add a graphic of the strategy section of the discord server
 
<aside class="red-aside">The simplest level is only paying attention to announcements as well as internal polls. Perfect for those who want their strat as a grab-and-go meal.</aside>

<aside class="yellow-aside">Next level down, are the actual discussion and pitching process.<br>
<span class="channel">#voting-discussion</span> is where you talk out ideas, treat every idea as a good faith idea.<br>
<span class="channel">#voting-pitches</span> is where fleshed out ideas go. Pitches which meet a weekly threshold go on our ballot.
</aside>

<aside class="green-aside">This is where detailed information can be found. Discussion as to "what we should do" does not go here. Instead, expect qusetions like "what is Bob LastName's strength?"</aside>

<aside>"FK" stands for <a href="https://www.blaseball.wiki/w/Help:Forbidden_Knowledge">Forbidden Knowledge</a>. This is extra information about the game which is usually "opt in".<br><span class="yellow" style="text-transform:uppercase;"><strong>Story spoilers are not allowed here!</strong></span></aside>

<aside class="red-aside">The next layer of the burrito are the specialised channels.<br>Stadium talk goes in <span class="channel">#stadium-committee</span>.<br>Gift shop talk goes in <span class="channel">#gift-shop-discussion</span>.<br>Simple as that.</aside>
